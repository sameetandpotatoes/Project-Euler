# What It Includes
  This is a compilation of questions from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/), a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that test your ability to develop efficient algorithms.
  To provide a comparison, I time each problem in their respective language to see how long the program takes to arrive at the final answer. Project Euler has a one-minute rule for solving each of its questions, meaning that no program should take longer than a minute to run.
# Usage
  1. **Java**- `java NumberX.java`
  2. **Python** (Using Python 3)- `python3 PEX`
  3. **C**-
  4. **Ruby** (Using Ruby 2.0)- `ruby PEX`
